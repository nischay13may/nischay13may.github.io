I am Nischay, an engineer interested in Software Development.

At Oracle, I currently work on PSCR application. 

Prior to Oracle, I was at IBM working in Data Hub web applications. 
I am an alumni of Bengal College of Engg. and Technology, Durgapur. 

In my free time I try to learn something, contribute to open source and go travelling.
