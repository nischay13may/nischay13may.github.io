I am Nischay, an engineer interested in Software Development.

At IBM CIO, I currently work on Data Hub application. 

Prior to IBM, I was at TCS working infrastructure domain web applications. 
I am an alumni of Bengal College of Engg. and Technology, Durgapur. 

In my free time I try to learn something, contribute to open source and go travelling.
